Run the `babel.sh` script with the source file and the destination file name as input, example:
```bash
./babel.sh src/app.js app.js
```
Run the `server.sh` script to use the development live-server.

## Dependencies

For the first few modules I installed babel and live-server as global modules with

```
npm install -g babel-cli live-server
```

In module 6 I uninstalled them with

```
npm uninstall -g babel-cli live-sever
```
